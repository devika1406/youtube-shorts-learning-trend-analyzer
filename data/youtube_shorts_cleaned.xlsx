We are Maddy and Sascha and after working in the corporate world for quite some time, in 2021 we’ve decided to quit our 9to5 jobs and change our lives from the inside out. 
We got rid of most of our stuff, moved out of our apartment and started to #travel the world full-time, while documenting it for all of you in this little #travelvlog.
Like many of us, we’ve been dreaming of this adventure for years. Now it’s time for us to make it a reality and become a full-time #travelcouple!

Come and join us on this wild ride!

You might be a #highlysensitiveperson like me. 🌼 I noticed that ever since I was little my nervous system gets easily dysregulated so I can't seem to focus and feel anxious in unfamiliar environments. This also started affecting my work life as a health professional. Now I am starting to listen to my nervous system and see what work conditions best suit my highly sensitive nervous system. As a practising Occupational Therapist, I help my clients with the same thing! I began to see that I myself also have sensory preferences too and I'm always ignoring it. Once I started to accept that yes I might need a more calming work environment, I felt like I was finally listening to my needs and putting myself first.

With principled functional training, we believe everyone can beat chronic pain and get strong, mobile, and resilient.

We help you tear down fear and build up muscle. We help you break free of limitations so you can move with confidence. We help you think right, move right, and feel right. 

Matt Hsu's own battle with chronic pain from the age of 16 in his feet, knees, hips, back, shoulders, elbows, forearms, wrists, hands, and head gives him a uniquely thorough understanding of musculoskeletal pain, the ways in which it can undermine an entire life, and the mental and physical hurdles that keep people from getting out of it.

When not filming videos, he's working out in the living room, surfing, learning dance or gymnastics moves, or riding a bike with his son in tow.

The first one is no feeling is final. Emotions come and go; they’re temporary. So if you're going through something rough, it will eventually end. 

Another tip is that your thoughts are the only thing you have complete control over in your life. So be mindful of your thoughts. Focus on the good and not the bad. And I don’t mean that everything should be puppies and rainbows. What I’m saying that you have a choice in every situation to focus on the good or to focus on the bad --  to see yourself as a hero or to see yourself as a victim. You get to decide.

If you aren't seeing your therapist any time soon, here's a little check-list that helps me, and maybe could help you!:
Move: Stand up and go for a mental health walk outside 🍃 or take out your stress on some heavy weights
Connect with Someone: When was the last time you reached out to someone who you love?
Nourish: Have you eaten yet? When was the last time you drank some water?

One of the most important tips I would recommend is to try and keep active and go outside for a walk in nature/park/ outdoors (if your government allows this in your region).

Often we can be stuck indoors with the rise in working from home and the natural exercise and movement we would get are now lost. Covid-19 has had a big impact on how we feel, and the sooner we can get vaccination rolled out the sooner we can go back to normality.

It is obviously not the only way to get your mental health better, but it is often one of the steps if you are able to take it. I would also encourage meditation and mindfulness, if you feel you have developed depression or anxiety during this pandemic then I would encourage you to speak to your GP/Family doctors.

In this episode we meet Jennifer. Her powerful story about experiencing joint pain, mood swings, and depression will directly connect you to the emotional and physical struggles that perimenopause symptoms create in a woman’s life. In Jennifer’s case these brutal symptoms have left her fighting suicidal thoughts and deep anxiety.

Jennifer’s story is not uncommon, and the courage she has shown publicly sharing her story will, if nothing else, let other women impacted by severe symptoms know they are not alone. Jennifer's video will also give you hope. 

Despite all the hardships, she shares how she has coped, what she has done to keep her marriage sound, and how she has turned this time of turmoil into a means of giving back by starting a company focused on women’s health.  

Experiencing menopause symptoms can make you feel caught off guard, out of control, confused and alone.

Across all industries, employers and industry leaders are identifying soft skills like communication, teamwork, time management, emotional intelligence, and leadership as critical skills for job hunters and employees alike. Yet, these core skills and several others are relatively absent in the traditional education model. The result is students who become employees without the requisite abilities to excel in their careers. SkillsCamp teaches this “missing curriculum” to help people become more employable and more effective leaders and contributors.

JwMks9ifSx4,Ditch these 4 habits and watch your grades improve,Elise Pham,2023-12-26 03:45:46+00:00,"The reality of common habits 🧠⬇️ 

1. Re-writing your notes: Note-taking is a  passive action that creates an illusion of productivity. In reality, testing your ability to recall information is the key to forming neural connections.  

2. Re-reading your textbook: Avoid doing this as your main method of studying for an exam. It’s a low-utility action that doesn’t allow you to discover your knowledge gaps. 

3. Pulling all-nighters: Deep rest builds neuroplasticity. Despite studying hard, if you don’t sleep enough, your ability to memorize information long-term is reduced. 

4. Ignoring your biological cycle: Everyone’s peak productivity time differs. Identify yours and set aside that period of time for intense study sessions. Trying to study hard when your body isn’t at its peak leads to unproductive work.

📖When your teacher assigns you textbook chapters, do you just open your textbook and begin reading?

❌If so, you’re doing it WRONG. 

📚Before you start reading, you need to PREPARE for active reading. Here’s how:

1️⃣ Read the introduction and conclusion of the chapter

2️⃣ Read headings and captions, and look at figures and images. 

3️⃣ Generate questions that you want to answer through the reading. 

4️⃣ Apply my secret active reading technique that dives deep into using metacognition! For an in-depth breakdown of this technique and how to unlock your intellectual potential, follow to stay tuned for the release of my Mind Mastery Course!

YanXZQov-_0,Study Skills – Effective Tips for Students,Taylor & Francis Books,2020-08-25 10:27:33+00:00,"Why do study skills matter? Study skills encompass a range of approaches to learning that enhance your ability to study, retain, and recall information. Improving these skills can lead to better academic results.

Time Management 
Start each term by noting down all due dates and planning backwards to determine when to begin each piece of coursework. Allow yourself extra time to handle unexpected issues, but stick to your schedule to stay on track.

Learning Tools 
Everyone learns differently, but tools like flashcards, mnemonics, and mind maps can be very effective. If you're having trouble with a concept, your lecturer can suggest helpful tools to improve your understanding.

Note Taking 
Focus on jotting down key thoughts and concepts during lectures, rather than everything you hear. Use color coding to help you remember these concepts when you review your notes.

Critical Thinking 
Critical thinking involves using your reasoning skills to question and analyze the ideas you're learning about. Enhancing your critical thinking is crucial for a deeper understanding of your subject.

Ask Questions 
Asking questions is a valuable skill. It shows your engagement in class and helps clarify any confusing areas.

Study Groups 
Joining a study group can provide support and new perspectives on your course material. It also helps build teamwork skills and can offer insights you might not have considered.

Wellbeing 
Taking care of yourself is essential amidst the pressures of university life. Make time for friends, exercise, and rest. Balancing work and self-care leads to better academic performance.

============================================

“Lead Fighter” — That’s the title Anik Singal gives himself as a high-energy, trailblazing Entrepreneur.

Anik got his start in the online scene back in 2003 from his college dorm room.

Ever since then he’s gone on to build 6 successful companies, launched 22 top brands, generated over $250 Million in sales, and taught over 250,000 students worldwide - how to start, grow, and scale a successful online business.

As the founder of Lurn, Inc., 

Anik Singal’s passion is in creating dynamic online classroom environments that teach people how to enhance their business, financial, and personal lives. 

Anik Singal has become a go-to authority in the areas of...

✅Digital Publishing.
✅Event-Based Marketing.
✅Product Launches.
✅Email Marketing.

Anik has been voted one of the Top 3 Young Entrepreneurs by BusinessWeek Magazine. In addition, his company earned the prestigious Inc. 500 Fastest Growing Companies in America two years in a row.

All of Anik’s experiences have made him the person he is today…

From struggling for 18 months when he first started, then successfully building his business to over $10 Million a year.

Then losing it all and falling to $1.7 Million in debt and almost declaring bankruptcy. 

Bouncing back and generating over $10 million in 16 months, paying back all of his debt and he hasn’t looked back since.

He’s worked with and has been endorsed by some of the most influential Entrepreneurs of our time... 

Including Robert Kiyosaki, Les Brown, Daymond John, Bob Proctor, Grant Cardone, and many more.

Anik is a dreamer. A thinker. A fighter. Most importantly, Anik is a teacher.

His immediate goal is empowering 1 Million Entrepreneurs to live the life of their dreams by the end of 2019.

From struggling for 18 months when he first started, then successfully building his business to over $10 Million a year.

Then losing it all and falling to $1.7 Million in debt and almost declaring bankruptcy. 

Bouncing back and generating over $10 million in 16 months, paying back all of his debt and he hasn’t looked back since.

He’s worked with and has been endorsed by some of the most influential Entrepreneurs of our time... 

Including Robert Kiyosaki, Les Brown, Daymond John, Bob Proctor, Grant Cardone, and many more.

Anik is a dreamer. A thinker. A fighter. Most importantly, Anik is a teacher.

His immediate goal is empowering 1 Million Entrepreneurs to live the life of their dreams by the end of 2019.
